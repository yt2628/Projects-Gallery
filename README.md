# Projects-Gallery

Welcome! My name is Eva Tao, currently a Master's student in the Measurement and Evaluation program in Columbia University. I study quantitative methodology as well as evaluation designs. I'm passionate about statistical modeling and data analysis. I enjoy creating data insights into students' development and making data-informed improvements to educational programs. I am also interested in quantifying latent characteristics (e.g. students' problem-solving skills; prospective employees' personality) through psychological measurement.

You can take a look at some of my past projects:
### Individual Projects
* [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/yt2628/Natural-Language-Processing)
Through natural language processing, we can shed light on prevailing topics, sentiments, etc. in students' notes, with visualizations.
* [Neural Networks](https://github.com/yt2628/Neural-Networks)
A neural network that predicts whether or not a student is paying attention in class, based on data of webcam images.
* [Collaborative Filtering Recommender System](https://github.com/yt2628/Recommender-Systems-Collaborative-Filter)
Use collaborative filtering to recommend a suitable "next topic to study" for students to work on
